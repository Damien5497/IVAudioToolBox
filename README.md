IV Audio ToolBox v0.1.4 (December 6th, 2012) - by Flitskikker
=============================================================

IV Audio ToolBox is designed for easily editing GTA IV audio files. Currently it supports both compressed and uncompressed single channel files.


Notes
-----

Currently only compressed and uncompressed single channel files are supported.
I might find time in the future to continue working on multi channel support, which is now only possible through external buggy tools.

If you've downloaded the source code, feel free to try adding it yourself (based on e.g. SparkIV and the current code). Please note that I made this tool a while ago before I learned to implement proper object orientation, so the current code is quite messy.

I hope you like the tool. :)
